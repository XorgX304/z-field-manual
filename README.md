## Attack Infrastructure

MITRE PRE-ATT&CK: [TA0022](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0022/)

## Getting Access

*Tactical goal: get IP address in target's internal network*

MITRE ATT&CK: [TA0001](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/)

## Discovery

*Tactical goal: Understand the target environment*

MITRE ATT&CK: [TA0007](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/)

Questions that should be asked:

```
What's the network topology? Is it flat?
Where are egress points?
Where are "multi-homed" boxes?
```

## Credential Access

*Tactical goal: Acquire valid set of credentials*

MITRE ATT&CK: [TA0006](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/)

## Lateral Movement
